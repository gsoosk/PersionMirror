Making a Mirror
====

[A tutorial video to make a smart mirror](https://learn.adafruit.com/android-smart-home-mirror)

1. Obtain Android device
----
We had too many. Sad old devices are ideal.

2. Obtain two-way mirror
---
We did this by buying a `reflective glass`.

Get a glass at least as large as your Android device. My mirror is 6"x12" with 1/8 thickness. 

3. Attach black backing
---
We used black construction paper. If your device and mirror are awesomely identical in size, you can skip this.

Note: You want to glue it well, so the backing doesn't tear when the adhesive is holding it.

* Cut a piece of black backing the same size as your mirror
* Decide where you want your device to show through. We did upper right. Leave a border all the way around for adhesive.
* At that location, carefully cut a hole in the backing the same size as your device
* CAREFULLY glue the backing to the mirror. We used spray adhesive, and practiced how we would pick it up and lay it on the mirror a couple times before going for it. We also wore black surgical gloves.
 

4. Adhesion
---
Fire up the app on the device.

Put the adhesive along the bezel or edges of the device. Line up the mirror and stick it on there.

5. Wall spot
---
You probably want a long usb cable. Find a wall spot where you can keep the device plugged in.

Put a bunch of adhesive on the back of the device, and stick it on there.
